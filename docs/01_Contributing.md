### Bugs

In reporting bugs we ask if you can be very specific of the issue and write in detail the error you are receiving. It should be explained in a way that if you were to come back 6 months later and saw your issue, you would be right up to speed as to what the problem is. The title should summarize what the issue is and the description should have extensive detail, including any logs, more information the better.

### Branch

#### Bug fixes

All bug fixes should be sent to the `dev-master` branch of the application. We will not accept pull-request (PR) from your `master` branch.

#### Feature Addons.

We welcome new features and ideas that are specific to social networking. All contributions should follow the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standard and the [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) autoloading standard. We will only accept PR's from your named branches with unit of functional.
